# scrape the website below to retrieve the top 5 countries with the highest GDPs. Calculate the GDP per capita
# by dividing the GDP by the population. You can perform the calculation in Python natively or insert the code
# in excel that will perform the calculation in Excel by each row. DO NOT scrape the GDP per capita from the
# webpage, make sure you use your own calculation.
